Q1 : Write a program to find the product of two numbers using pointers.
-->
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
void productor(int x,int y, int *ptr){
  *ptr=x*y;
}
int main(){
    int x,y;
    cout<<"Enter the value of two numbers : "<<endl;
    cin>>x>>y;
    int product;
    
    productor(x,y,&product);
    cout<<product;
}

Q2 : int *p, q;
p is a pointer and q is an integer.
p and q both are pointers.
P and q both are integers.
Syntax is incorrect.

-->
p is a pointer and q is an integer.

Q3: Find the output of the following code snippet.
int a = 10, b = 20;
int *ptr = &a;
b = *ptr + 1;
ptr = &b;
cout << *ptr << ‘ ‘ << a << ‘ ‘ << b;
11 11 10
10 10 10
11 10 11
10 11 10

-->
11 10 11

Q4: Find the output of the following code snippet.
int a = 15, b = 20;
int *ptr = &a;
int *ptr2 = &b;
*ptr = *ptr2;
ptr now points to b
ptr2 now points to a
a gets value of b
b gets value of a
-->
a gets value of b

Q5: Is the following program snippet correct?
int a = 10, b = 20;
int *ptr;
*ptr = 5;
--> yes donot show error but in genral in pointer variable we store address;
